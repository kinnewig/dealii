Fixed: The SUNDIALS::ARKODE::solve_ode() function returned the number
of time steps at which the intermediate output function was called,
rather than the number of time steps performed as promised in the
documentation. This has now been fixed.
<br>
The same bug also existed in the SUNDIALS::IDA::solve_dae() function,
where it has also been fixed.
