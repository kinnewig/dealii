Changed: The Quadrature class used to have a constructor that took an
integer argument. This was error-prone because it was easy to accidentally
write
@code
  Quadrature<dim> quadrature(3);
@endcode
where
@code
  QGauss<dim> quadrature(3);
@endcode
was meant. As a consequence, this constructor has been removed from the `public`
interface of the class.
