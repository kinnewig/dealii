Deprecated: The entire LocalIntegrators namespace has been
deprecated. The namespace represents an effort at making integration
simpler by providing a library of terms that appear frequently in
equations. But this only made the simple case simple -- everything
that exceeded the simplest case still needed to be done by hand, and
using these pre-built integrators did not help teaching how to do
that. As a consequence, these pre-built integrators will be removed in
a future version of the library.
