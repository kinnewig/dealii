     * This class implements a wrapper to use the Trilinos distributed sparse
     * matrix class
     * <a
     * href="https://docs.trilinos.org/dev/packages/tpetra/doc/html/classTpetra_1_1CrsMatrix.html">Tpetra::CrsMatrix</a>.
     * This is precisely the kind of matrix we deal with all the time - we
     * most likely get it from some assembly process, where also entries not
     * locally owned might need to be written and hence need to be forwarded
     * to the owner process. This class is designed to be used in a distributed
     * memory architecture with an MPI compiler on the bottom, but it works
     * equally well for serial processes. The only requirement for this class to
     * work is that Trilinos has been installed with the same compiler as is
     * used for generating deal.II.
     *
     * Moreover, this class takes an optional template argument for
     * Kokkos::Nodes, allowing the usage of different Kokkos::Nodes.
     * Kokkos allows the writing of portable applications targeting,
     * for example, CUDA, OpenMP, Serial, or Threads, as backends for
     * the execution and memory spaces. The backend is chosen by
     * choosing the corresponding Kokkos Node.
     *
     * The interface of this class is modeled after the existing SparseMatrix
     * class in deal.II. It has almost the same member functions and is often
     * exchangeable. This class is templated and can be used with different
     * scalar types. However, Trilinos need to be installed with complex support
     * for usage with complex scalar types.
     *
     * @note You need to call SparseMatrix::compress() before you actually use
     * the matrix. This calls
     * <a
     * href="https://docs.trilinos.org/dev/packages/tpetra/doc/html/classTpetra_1_1CrsMatrix.html#aa985b225a24d2f74602e25b38b4430af">Tpetra::fillComplete</a>
     * that compresses the storage format for sparse matrices by discarding
     * unused elements and prepares the matrix for further usage
     * (e.g., for matrix-vector products).
     * However, to continue assembling the matrix, you need to call
     * SparseMatrix::resume_fill() first. Once you finish modifying
     * the matrix, you must call SparseMatrix::compress() again.
